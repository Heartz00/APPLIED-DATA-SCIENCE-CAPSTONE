# APPLIED-DATA-SCIENCE-CAPSTONE
This consist of my Data science project on the prediction of a successful landing of Falcon 9 rocket from the spacex company
Worked on SpaceX launch datasets , seeing as how SPACEX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launch on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars,, which is cheap compares to other providers of 165 million dollars upward each, much of the savings is done due to the fact that SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
    A scenario where a competing space company needed to bid against them was created, hence this company needed to know how to predict if the Falcon 9 stage will land successfully and also the variables that are major determining factors on these outcomes 
  What I did : I extracted the data from Wikipedia using #Webscraping technique and also from #SPACEX #API , then I cleaned the data which I performed several predictive (classification) #machinelearningalgorithms model and found the #decisiontree   model to be the best with accuracy of 88% then I finally built an interactive dashboard deployed on #streamlit ....

     you can view the dashboard below or thought this link --> https://heartz00-streamlit-dashboard-app-depl-reallife-dashboard-q3oskq.streamlitapp.com/
we can build and deploy our web apps.
